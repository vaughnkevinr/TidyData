#Getting and Cleaning Data Project

##This is the exercise for 'Getting and Cleaning Data' Course

To run this code you will need this data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Unzip the file, make sure you have the 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory and its subdirectories inside your working directory.

Run run_analysis.R in order to:

##Merge both training and test sets.
##Include the subjects who performed the activities.
##Properly label all the data.
##Subset the data using only subjects and measurement that are mean values or standard deviation values.
##Create a tidy data set with the average of each of the variables on the data subset for each activity and each subject.
##Export the final tidy data set to a 'Tidy.txt' file.
